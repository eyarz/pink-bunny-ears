This session will introduce participants to the world of prompt engineering using GitHub Copilot, a tool that leverages machine learning to provide code suggestions.  
It is geared towards beginners who want to improve their coding skills and learn how to use this powerful tool to increase their productivity.  
The session will cover the basics of prompt engineering, including how to create prompts, customize them, and use them to generate code.  
Participants will have the opportunity to see Copilot in action and learn best practices for incorporating it into their workflow.  
By the end of the meetup, attendees will have a solid foundation in prompt engineering and be able to confidently use GitHub Copilot to write better code.
